               "Simplifying household management, one task at a time."
            </p>
            <p style="text-align: justify;">
               RoomieTasks is a collaborative task management platform designed specifically for shared living spaces. Whether you're living with roommates in a college dorm, sharing an apartment with friends, or managing household chores with family members, RoomieTasks helps you organize, assign, and track responsibilities efficiently.
            </p>
            <p style="text-align: justify;">
               <strong>The Problem:</strong> Living with others often leads to confusion about who should handle which chores, resulting in tasks being forgotten, duplicated, or unfairly distributed. This creates tension and conflicts that can strain relationships.
            </p>
            <p style="text-align: justify;">
               <strong>Our Solution:</strong> RoomieTasks provides a central hub where all household members can see what needs to be done, who's responsible for each task, and when tasks are due. By bringing transparency and accountability to household management, we help create harmony in shared living spaces.

            <p style="text-align: justify;">
               <strong>1. Create or Join a Household</strong><br>
               Start by creating a new household or joining an existing one using an invite code from another member.
            </p>
            <p style="text-align: justify;">
               <strong>2. Add and Assign Tasks</strong><br>
               Create tasks for your household, set due dates, priority levels, and assign them to specific members or yourself.
            </p>
            <p style="text-align: justify;">
               <strong>3. Track Progress</strong><br>
               Mark tasks as completed when done. For recurring tasks, the next occurrence is automatically created.

               <strong>4. Monitor with Analytics</strong><br>
